game mode selector
    restart button refreshes boards
    need a third hidden board
    store in a variable that how many and what kind of ships on how big board

    I would split the game in 4 parts: player places ships - at the same time AI places ships.

    we can have a board checker function used by the AI and the player to place ships (validates how many ships and if
    those are next to each other

when both AI and player placed their ships

shooting phase

player shoots on board / result gets wrote out and ai should shoot automatically
then player shoots
and so on when someone sinks all the ships, its game over

things to store in global variables:

- game mode perhaps
- game phase
- if the ai shoots (when shot, the player is allowed to shoot again)
- if its game over
- perhaps game modes, and everything ssociated with it. board size, ships to place, ship size, etc

functions to create:
board validator
ship placer
shooter
AI shooter
